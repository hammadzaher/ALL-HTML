    <h1>INTRODUCTION HTML</h1>
    <p>
        <ul>
           <b> <li>HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language</li>
            <li>HTML is the standard markup language for creating Web pages</li>
            <li>HTML describes the structure of a Web page</li></b>
            <i><li>HTML elements tell the browser how to display the content</li>
           <li>HTML consists of a series of elements</li>
           <li>HTML elements label pieces of content such as "this is a heading", "this is a paragraph", "this is a link", etc.</li></i> 
        </ul>
    </p>
    <h2>EXTRA INFORMATION HTML</h2>
    <P><i>At its heart, HTML is a language made up of elements, which can be applied to pieces of text to give them different meaning in a document (Is it a paragraph? Is it a bulleted list? Is it part of a table?), structure a document into logical sections (Does it have a header? Three columns of content? A navigation menu?), and embed content such as images and videos into a page. This module will introduce the first two of these and introduce fundamental concepts and syntax you need to know to understand HTML.</i></P>
